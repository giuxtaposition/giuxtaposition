# Giulia Ye @giuxtaposition

- 💼 I’m currently working at [@Claranet](https://www.claranet.it/).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Storybook, Svelte and frontend testing.
- 👟 In my free time I like running, cooking and just generally being a tiny little nerd ;)
- ⚡ Fun fact: giuxtaposition is a pun on my name (Giulia) and juxtaposition.
