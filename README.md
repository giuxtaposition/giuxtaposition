# Giulia Ye @giuxtaposition

- 💼 I’m currently working at [@XPeppers](https://www.claranet.it/) (Claranet Italia).
- 🌱 I’m learning Storybook, Svelte and frontend testing and also how to build cloud native apps with AWS.
- 👟 In my free time I like running, cooking and just generally being a tiny little nerd ;)
- ⚡ Fun fact: giuxtaposition is a pun on my name (Giulia) and juxtaposition.
