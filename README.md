# Giulia Ye @giuxtaposition

- 🔭 I’m currently working on expanding my knowledge.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React Native and Python.
- 👟 In my free time I like running, cooking and just generally being a tiny little nerd ;)
- ⚡ Fun fact: giuxtaposition is a pun on my name (Giulia) and juxtaposition.
